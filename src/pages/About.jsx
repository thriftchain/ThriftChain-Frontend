                The use of smart contracts in ThriftChain automates various
                aspects of the platform. Smart contracts manage individual and
                group-based savings, including the deduction of funds from users
                wallets, tracking progress, and releasing savings upon maturity.
                This automation reduces the need for manual intervention,
                increasing efficiency and reliability in the savings process.
